Monte Carlo vs Markowitz Portfolio Optimization
This app (app.py) operates on Kaggle data (linked below) to perform Monte Carlo simulations and Markowitz Mean Variance Optimizations on a selected subset of the available companies to determine the optimal weight for each company in one's portfolio. Along with the weights and their Sharpe ratio, which is used to determine how optimal the weights are, it also returns data about the time spent and memory used to perform each operation seperately
We intended our program to work as both an effective tool for building optimal portfolios and a study on the effectiveness and efficiency of the methods involved.
To run the program from terminal, run the following command:
streamlit run C:\Users\dylan\PycharmProjects\COP3530_project2_group86\app.py
This should pull up our app in your browser. From here, there's a dropdown member listing 500 companies you can include in your analysis by their ticker abbreviation. You can also type the ticker abbrevation in the box and it'll pull up the appropriate company. The program updates the weights, graphs, time, and memory upon each addition or removal of a company.
